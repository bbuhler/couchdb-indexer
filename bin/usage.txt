USAGE

  ixcouch [options] <database_url>

DESCRIPTION

  Triggers indexing of all views on a CouchDB database by querying 1 view from each design document that contains one.

  Exits on completion.

OPTIONS

  --filter=<string>
    Only index views on design docs whose names match JavaScript RegExp

  --max-active-tasks=<integer>
    View queries are queued so as to attempt to limit the maximum number of concurrent active tasks on the CouchDB server.
    Active tasks are queried via route: GET {server_url}/_active_tasks.

    By default, there is no maximum - i.e. all view queries are sent simultaneously.

DATABASE URL

    Can be supplied in various formats:

      Full URL

      {host}/{database_name} - inferred protocol: http

      :{port}/{database_name} - inferred protocol: http; inferred hostname: 127.0.0.1

      {database_name} - inferred protocol: http; inferred host: 127.0.0.1:5984
